These are programs written during my studies in the course "data processing structures and algorithms".

1. [task 1](saod_1_2_1.cpp) - stack on static memory allocation.
2. [task 2](saod_1_2_2.cpp) - stack on dynamic memory allocation.
3. [task 3](saod_1_2_3.cpp) - like task 2, but with random filling instead.
4. [task 4](saod_1_2_4.cpp) - added the ability to transfer to the auxiliary stack.
